# Chris Barker 

Hi.  I'm a Professor of Linguistics at New York University.  You can email me at <chris.barker@nyu.edu>.

Here is [my CV](barker-cv.pdf), and here is my [Google Scholar web page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LnwVXPIAAAAJ).

* **Research**: I'm a semanticist, that is, I study natural language meaning.  These days I've been working on scope, dynamics, and update.  I love to talk to linguists, philosophers of language, and computer scientists, and I'm especially interested in adapting techniques from functional programming such as functors, monads, and continuations.   

* **Teaching**: I developed and teach a general-education course called *Meaning*, which is part of the Texts and Ideas component of the Humanities CORE at NYU.  We engage with the work of Aristotle, Bacon, Wittgenstein, Grice, and many others.  Creating meaning is one of the supreme activities of the human species--but what, exactly, are we doing when we create meaning?  How should we think about meaning?  I also teach Introduction to Semantics in the Linguistics department, as well as courses and seminars at the graduate level.

* **Current Projects**:
  * I've been working lately on scope, both on the theory of scope taking, and on the empirical landscape of scope islands.  
    * [Rethinking scope islands](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/ling_a_00419).  2021. *Linguistic Inquiry*.  Contrary to the standard wisdom, abundant naturally-occuring data shows that clauses are not scope islands.  Preprint and Haskell code available here: https://github.com/cb125/scope-islands
    * [The logic of Quantifier Raising](https://doi.org/10.3765/sp.13.20).  2020. *Semantics and Pragmatics*, Early Access.  The first study of the formal properties of Quantifier Raising.  I show that QR is decidable, even in the presence of unrestricted type lifting.
    * [NL-lambda as the Logic of Scope and Movement](https://rdcu.be/cdsdC). 2019. *Journal of Logic, Language and Information* **28**, 217â€“237.  Decidability, interpolation, and soundness and completeness proofs for a logic with Quantifier Raising and a unit, which can characterize both overt and covert movement.

I'm rebuilding (November 2020) my professional web page (this page), please be patient...
