# Chris Barker

Hi.  I'm a Professor of Linguistics at New York University.  You can email me at <chris.barker@nyu.edu>.

Here is [my CV](barker-cv.pdf), and here is my [Google Scholar web page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LnwVXPIAAAAJ).

I'm a semanticist, that is, I study natural language meaning.  These days I've been working on scope, dynamics, and update.  I love to talk to linguists, philosophers of language, and computer scientists, and I'm especially interested in adapting techniques from functional programming such as functors, monads, and continuations.   

I'm rebuilding (November 2020) my professional web page (this page), please be patient...
