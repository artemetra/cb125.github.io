Hi.  I'm a Professor of Linguistics at New York University.  You can email me at <chris.barker@nyu.edu>.

Here is [my CV](barker-cv.pdf), and here is my [Google Scholar web page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LnwVXPIAAAAJ).

**Research**: I'm a semanticist, that is, I study natural language meaning.  These days I've been working on scope, dynamics, and update.  I love to talk to linguists, philosophers of language, and computer scientists, and I'm especially interested in adapting techniques from functional programming such as functors, monads, and continuations.   

**Teaching**: I developed and teach a general-education course called *Meaning*, which is part of the Texts and Ideas component of the Humanities CORE at NYU.  We engage with the work of Aristotle, Bacon, Wittgenstein, Grice, and many others.  Creating meaning is one of the supreme activities of the human species--but what, exactly, are we doing when we create meaning?  How should we think about meaning?  I also teach Introduction to Semantics in the Linguistics department, as well as courses and seminars at the graduate level.

I'm rebuilding (November 2020) my professional web page (this page), please be patient...
